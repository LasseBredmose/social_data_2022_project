# Notes 

## Ideas
### Plots
- Temporal patterns
    - If we can get the data: Patterns each hour
    - Patterns for 1 year
    - Patterns for multiple years
- Spatial patterns
    - Heatmap for measurements taken
- Histogram
    - Bikes 🚲
    - Cars 🚗
    - Pedestrians 🚶‍♀️
    - Electric scooter 🛴
- Boxplot of years? Bikes?

### Machine Learning
- Cars VS bikes!
    - Weather: What mode of transport is taken when weather is good vs bad? 🌨🌧❄️
- Bias:
    - Good weather VS bad weather
        - Is our ML model too influenced by days where the weather is good?

## Pitch - 60 seconds
* Introduction to the data and why
  * What is the idea?
  * Which datasets have we chosen and why?
  * Why is interesting
* Mock up of visualisation
  * What kind of visualisation we want to show
* Genre
  * Talk about the data
* Metadata
  * Total size, MB, number of rows etc
  * What kind of data - data range, properties etc
  * Fundamentals aspects of the data
