### Introduction
* ðŸš²ðŸš²ðŸš² --- Biking to a cleaner future --- ðŸš²ðŸš²ðŸš²

* You read it in the paper, you hear in the news, but what can you do for a cleaner tomorrow? 
  * Are you part of the problem or the solution? 
  * In this project we will analyse the transition from bike to car in greater Copenhagen.
  * Hereby examinating when we take the bike/car, the reason behind it and what influence the politicians have, all done by datasets provided from OpenData(Teknik- og miljÃ¸forvaltningen).
  * Further more, we analyse what impact the weather have and if there exists a corralataion between weather and biking using ML on provided data from DMI.

### Visualisation
* To strengthen our report and support our foundings, visualisations tools such as Bokeh and plotly are used. 
* Here we incorporate heatmaps, daily histograms and add more plots
  * wainting for inputs.
* All formatted in a nicely magazine/slideshow genre. 
* Thus providing a nice focus on the research while making the story visually interesting, in order to incapsulate the reader.


### Metadata
* The data is collected through 3 different data-sources, ranging from the years 2009 to 2019. 
* The primary dataset consist of [insert rows] and the following columns[insert columns] creating a file size of approximately 12,9MB:
* The data consist of preprocessed data, where we can easily extract relevant data for each counting spot. 
* Each spot is counted one whole day each year, all manually done. 

### End - 80-90 secs



  * We have daily countings[show columns] ranging from 07-19 resulting in 3716 rows. 
  * The file is appoximately 12,9MB
* OpenData: 
  * We have pre-processed data for an average day[show columns], where relevant features have been extracted
  * The file is appoximately 0.272 MB
* The DMIData:
  * From DMI we have a simplified measure of a good/bad-weather-index for the corrosponding days. 
  * Inser more Meta
* Insert some plots of our data. 




### Fundamentals visualisations


## Pitch - 60 seconds
* Introduction to the data and why
  * What is the idea?
  * Which datasets have we chosen and why?
  * Why is interesting
* Mock up of visualisation
  * What kind of visualisation we want to show
* Genre
  * Talk about the data
* Metadata
  * Total size, MB, number of rows etc
  * What kind of data - data range, properties etc
  * Fundamentals aspects of the data 





* Today there are even more incentive to leave the car and take the bike.

  When do we take the bike and what trends can be seen is analysed via datasets provided from Opendata

  This and more will be analysed, when look at the data collected from Opendata and DMI, and 
  * In this project we will analyse the transition from car to bike in greater Copenhagen, and make you a part of the solution.
  
  * When do we take the bike, does the weather affects our habbits, and can the impact from the politicians be seen in the data?
  * This and more will be answered, when we look at the data collected from Opendata and DMI, and make you a part of the solution

  * Have you noticed the increasing difficulty in parking spaces? The super fine new bike lanes? 

* During recent years there has been an increasing interest for greener mobiblity, and a move away from fossil fuels. 
  * Providing cleaner air in the greater Copenhagen area. 
  * Political initiatives improving conditions(bike lanes, bike parking) for bicycling while reducing the incentive(parking slots, taxes etc) to take the car
* We want to explore how Copenhagen has adjusted their mobility trends in order to combat the climate change 
  * and if the initiatives can be spotted in the data(have the they helped at all?)
